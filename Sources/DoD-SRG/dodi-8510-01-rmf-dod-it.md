DoDI 8510.01, July 19, 2022
SECTION 3: DOD AND NIST RMF IMPLEMENTATION
3.1. OVERVIEW.
The RMF process for lifecycle cybersecurity risk to DoD systems is in accordance with the NIST
SP 800-30, 800-37, 800-39, 800-53A, 800-137, Committee on National Security Systems Policy
No. 22, CNSSI No. 1253 and 1254, DoDD 8000.01, and DoDI 8500.01. The RMF process
adopts the NIST RMF in accordance with NIST SP 800-37 to comply with FISMA requirements.
This process is intended to ensure DoD systems with digital capabilities, including National
Security Systems, are engineered for cyber survivability. This is done by integrating controls
that support security, privacy, operational resilience, supply chain risk management, and the best
cyber intelligence, or commercial cyber threat information available at the system and
organizational levels.
a. The RMF consists of the steps depicted in Figure 1. This process integrates with the
system life-cycle and system security engineering processes. The program initiates or updates
RMF activities during system inception (e.g., documented during requirements identification)
and for any significant system modifications (e.g., engineering changes). Refer to the RMF KS
section on ‘System and Environment Changes’ for further information regarding what is
included in significant system modification.
Figure 1. RMF Process
b. Failure to initiate the RMF at system or program inception is not a justification for
ignoring or not complying with the RMF. Systems without an ATO must begin the RMF,
regardless of the system life-cycle stage (e.g., acquisition, operation). Chapter 3 of NIST SP
800-37 details the steps of the RMF, with additional guidance on the RMF KS.
SECTION 3: DOD AND NIST RMF IMPLEMENTATION 12

## Page 13

DoDI 8510.01, July 19, 2022
c. The RMF process applies to all systems and organizations regardless of acquisition
pathway in the DoD, as well as DoD partnered systems and organizations where it has been
agreed that DoD standards will be followed.
(1) DoD systems (e.g., weapons systems, stand-alone systems, control systems, or any
other type of systems with digital capabilities) must receive and maintain a valid authorization
before beginning operations. Refer to the RMF KS for additional guidance on authorizations.
(2) Technologies below the system level (e.g., system components, hardware, software,
external services) do not require an ATO. However, these technologies must still complete
specific RMF assessment procedures under the “Assess Only” process. Refer to the KS for more
information on these “Assess Only” processes.
3.2. RMF STEPS.
a. Prepare.
Prepare to execute the RMF from an organizational and system-level perspective by setting
context and priorities for privacy and security risk management to carry out essential activities at
the organization, mission and business process, and information system levels of the
organization. The “Prepare” step tasks must be completed by the DoD Component CIO, DoD
PAO, and JCA capability portfolio manager (CPM) to enable an effective risk-managed security
authorization process. See Table 1 for “Prepare” step tasks. For additional guidance, see the
RMF KS.

a. Overview.
The RMF is designed to complement and support the Defense Acquisition System activities,
milestones, and phases.
(1) RMF activities must be initiated as early as possible in the DoD acquisition process
to increase security and decrease cost.
(2) Requirements, development, procurement, and T&E processes must apply the RMF
in the acquisition of DoD information technology.
(3) Risks to systems must be designated consistent with the most severe threat to any
individual component or subcomponent for consideration of requirements, acquisition, and T&E.
b. Life-Cycle.
(1) The Adaptive Acquisition Framework is defined and illustrated in DoDI 5000.02.
(2) Alignment of RMF steps to the acquisition lifecycle can be found on the RMF KS.
(3) DoDI 5000.90 establishes policy for the acquisition PM’s role and responsibilities for
managing cybersecurity, including the RMF, throughout the program’s acquisition lifecycle.
(4) See DoDIs 5000.82, 5000.83, 5000.89, and 5000.90 for details on integrating RMF in

SECTION 4: CYBERSECURITY RISK GOVERNANCE
4.1. CYBERSECURITY RISK GOVERNANCE.
The DoD cybersecurity risk governance structure implements the three-level approach to the
cybersecurity risk management described in NIST SP 800-39. It synchronizes and integrates
cybersecurity activities across all phases of the system life-cycle, spanning logical and
organizational entities.
a. Within the cybersecurity risk governance structure, governance bodies (e.g., DoD
Information Security Risk Management Committee (DoD ISRMC), Defense
Security/Cybersecurity Authorization Working Group (DSAWG)) play a critical role in
cybersecurity risk acceptance for the DoD, mitigating critical vulnerabilities, integrating
information sharing, and ensuring a balance between organizational and tactical cybersecurity
risk.
b. Successful cybersecurity risk governance requires cooperation across all levels, including
governance bodies, organizational leadership, IOs or stewards, operational commanders, and
system-level owners and operators.
c. Governance elements are illustrated in Figure 2 and further explained in this section.
